- headless testing only unless you want a human test
- use sdl dummy audio driver
- static analysis is not good enough for this problem. you will need to debug dynamically by modding the emulator, with gdb, whatever you can!
- the goal is an ips patch for 30->60fps change. I know the cheat exists, we are looking for better here
- Use uv not raw python
- Make local tmp folder, not /tmp
